# garage-go-nogo-light
My final project for EECSX497.20.  It is a simple RED/GREEN go/no-go light controlled by a PING ultrasonic sensor written in AVR assembler for an ATmega2560.  It will turn on our green light until we are just slightly less than 2 feet away from our ultrasonic sensor and then it will turn on the red light and turn off the green light.
